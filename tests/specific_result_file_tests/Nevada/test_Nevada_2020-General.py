#   Change the constants to values from your file
#   Delete any tests for contest types your state doesn't have in 2020 (e.g., Florida has no US Senate contest)
#   (Optional) Change district numbers
#   Replace each '-1' with the correct number calculated from the results file.
#   Move this testing file to the correct jurisdiction folder in `election_data_analysis/tests`

# # # constants - CHANGE THESE!! - use internal db names
# PLEASE NOTE: Results are from the precinct level file which has the stipulation that in cases
# where the cumulative turnout for a race or ballot question in a single precinct is greater than
# zero but less than 10, numbers have been replaced with an asterisk (*) in order to protect the
# secrecy of a voter's ballot as required by Nevada Law.
