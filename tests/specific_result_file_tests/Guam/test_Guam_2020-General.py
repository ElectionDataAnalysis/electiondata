# Instructions:
#   Copy this template and rename, including your jurisdiction and the timestamp of the results file
#       following this model: test_North-Carolina_2020_General_20201113_1645.py
#           * start with test_ so pytest will find the file
#           * get the underscores and hyphens right, so the system will find the file
#           * timestamp is YYYYMMDD_xxxx, where xxxx is the military-time Pacific Standard Time
#           * (timestamp is crucial for files collected during recounts and evolving canvass counts)
#   Change the constants to values from your file
#   "triple-quote" out any tests for contest types your state doesn't have in 2020 (e.g., Florida has no US Senate contest)
#   (Optional) Change district numbers
#   Replace each '-1' with the correct number calculated from the results file.
#   Move this testing file to the correct jurisdiction folder in `election_data_analysis/tests`

# # # constants - CHANGE THESE!! - use internal db names
