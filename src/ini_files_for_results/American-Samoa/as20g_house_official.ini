results_note=TLG: the results were still listed under the heading of unofficial. However a news story https://www.samoanews.com/local-news/election-2020-results-now-certified-official has stated that the results are official (since it is past their 7 day waiting period). Results in the story matched the downloaded results. Their results are in PDF. However, I used tabula https://tabula.technology/ and the data pulls off cleanly.
